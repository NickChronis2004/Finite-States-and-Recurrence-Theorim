# Finite States and Recurrence in Causal Patches

This repository contains the LaTeX source and compiled PDF of the study **"Finite States and Recurrence in Causal Patches"** by Nikolaos Chronis.

## Overview

The work investigates the implications of having a *finite-dimensional Hilbert space* within a causal patch of spacetime, under holographic entropy bounds.  
By combining results from statistical mechanics, quantum information, and semiclassical gravity, we analyze the consequences for **Poincaré recurrences**, coarse-grained returns, and the operational meaning of recurrence times in realistic systems.

Key physical intuition:
- A **finite** Hilbert space dimension $D$ arises from gravitational entropy bounds (e.g., de Sitter horizon).
- This finiteness implies that, given enough time, quantum states will **recur** arbitrarily close to their initial configuration.
- Global recurrence times are astronomically large (double exponential in entropy), but **coarse-grained subsystem recurrences** are much shorter — although still well beyond cosmological timescales.

## Main Contributions

- A clear derivation of **finite $D$** from holographic considerations and gravitational energy limits.
- Explicit discussion of **global vs local/coarse-grained recurrence times**.
- Order-of-magnitude estimates connecting thermodynamic entropy to recurrence times.
- Conceptual bridge between **quantum information theory** and **cosmology**.
